just spedran this in the span of 2 hours, feelin good

### How it works
First, the program takes the value the user inputs as the desired index for the prime. From there, the program continuously generates
prime numbers until the length of the array containing the prime numbers is equivalent to the desired index. Each number is checked
by dividing it by all preceding primes and determining the remainder. The program starts with the value 2 pre-registered and checks each odd number
after that, since prime numbers must be odd.
